#8)Using your query that generates a username for all of the employees, generate a count employees for each unique username. Are there any duplicate usernames? BONUS: How many duplicate usernames are there?

SELECT lower(concat(substr(first_name,1, 1),
		substr(last_name, 1,4),
		"_",
		substr(birth_date,6,2),
		substr(birth_date,3,2)))
		AS employee_username,
		count(*) as count
FROM employees
GROUP BY employee_username
HAVING  count(*) > 1
ORDER BY count(*) DESC;

#Bonus = #12251 Duplicate Usernames

#Alternate way of solving
SELECT lower(concat(substr(first_name,1, 1),
		substr(last_name, 1,4),
		"_",
		substr(birth_date,6,2),
		substr(birth_date,3,2)))
		AS employee_username,
		count(*) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY employee_username
HAVING  count(employee_username) > 1
ORDER BY count(*) DESC;

#4)Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) from the Employee table in alphabetical order.

SELECT NAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY NAME ASC;

#5)Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) for employees in Employee having a salary greater than per month who have been employees for less than months. Sort your result by ascending employee_id.

SELECT NAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE SALARY > 2000 
AND MONTHS < 10
ORDER BY EMPLOYEE_ID ASC; 

#6)Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

SELECT  c.company_code,
        c.founder,  
        COUNT(distinct l.lead_manager_code), 
        COUNT(distinct s.senior_manager_code), 
        COUNT(distinct m.manager_code),
        COUNT(distinct e.employee_code)
from Company as c 
join Lead_Manager as l 
on c.company_code = l.company_code
join Senior_Manager as s
on l.lead_manager_code = s.lead_manager_code
join Manager as m 
on m.senior_manager_code = s.senior_manager_code
join Employee as e
on e.manager_code = m.manager_code
group by c.company_code, c.founder
order by c.company_code;
